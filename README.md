Publications
============

The publications below are a collection of research papers, book chapters, application notes, poster presentation, and conference talks.


## How To Get Started

- [Download the List](https://github.com/camilo-v/Publications/archive/master.zip) zip archive, and extract its contents.

## Communication

The below applies mostly to software code.

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue and _please provide detailed steps to reliably reproduce it_.
- If you have **feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **would like to contribute**, please submit a pull request.

## Research Papers

The research papers contained in this section are organized by the year in which they were published.  Do note that not all the papers below have been accepted for publication; but all have been submitted for peer-review.  In the cases for which they have not yet been published, I’ve added a parenthetical describing its status:

- **In Press**.  The paper has been accepted, but no journal particulars are available yet.
- **Re-Submitted**.  The paper has been submitted for peer review to a journal.  No revisions have been performed as per the request of the reviewers.
- **Submitted with Revisions**.  The paper was reviewed, and after addressing the reviewers comments, it has been re-submitted.

If you have any questions regarding any of the papers, please [contact me](mailto:cvaldes3@miami.edu), and I will do my best to respond in a timely manner.
